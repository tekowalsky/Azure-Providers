# tfe_organization_membership

Add or remove a user from an organization.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires using the provider with Terraform Cloud or
an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202004-1.

~> **NOTE:** This resource cannot be used to update an existing user's email address
since users themselves are the only ones permitted to update their email address.
If a user updates their email address, configurations using the email address should
be updated manually.
