# tfe_organization_module_sharing

Manage module sharing for an organization. This resource requires the
use of an admin token and is for Terraform Enterprise only.

-> **NOTE:** `TfeOrganizationModuleSharing` is deprecated in favor of using `TfeAdminOrganizationSettings` which also allows the management of the global module sharing setting. They attempt to manage the same resource and are mutually exclusive.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```csharp
using Constructs;
using HashiCorp.Cdktf;
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
using Gen.Providers.Tfe;
class MyConvertedCode : TerraformStack
{
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, string name) : base(scope, name)
    {
        new OrganizationModuleSharing.OrganizationModuleSharing(this, "test", new OrganizationModuleSharingConfig {
            ModuleConsumers = new [] { "my-org-name-2", "my-org-name-3" },
            Organization = "my-org-name"
        });
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `Organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `ModuleConsumers` - (Required) Names of the organizations to consume the module registry.
