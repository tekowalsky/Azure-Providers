# Welcome to the Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the official Terraform Cloud/Enterprise provider. We appreciate your help! If you're unsure or afraid of anything, you can submit a work in progress (WIP) pull request, or file an issue with the parts you know. We'll do our best to guide you in the right direction, and let you know if there are guidelines we will need to follow. We want people to be able to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing.

This guide is broken down into sections to help you [configure your environment](development-environment.md), [debug](debugging.md), and [test](testing.md) code to ensure your contribution can be included in a release.

If you are contributing a new feature that is not yet generally available, review our [beta feature policy](beta.md).
